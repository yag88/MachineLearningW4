# MachineLearningW4

This is YAG's Prediction Assignment Writeup.
Submitted for the Course Project of JHU's course on Practical Machine Learning. 

The files 
`PML-CourseProject.html`
and
`PML-CourseProject.Rmd`
have identical content. One is in Rmarkdown, the other in html. 

## for peer review: 
As Github does not let you read the html file in the correct format, I uploaded the same file on Rpubs here:
